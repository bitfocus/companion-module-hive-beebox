## Hive Beeblade Module

This module provides conntroll for the Hive Beeblade range of media engine products. It should also work for all derrivatives of the Beeblade such as Beebox, Beehive, Nucleus and to some extent older legacy models such as Player_1, Player_2, Player_3 and Player_4 although functionality on these devices may be limited.

For this module to work, the target device must be setup on the network and you will require it's IP address so that a communication channel can be established
